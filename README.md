2D Physics Engine I've been developing using OpenGL. Set up to work on Polygon-Polygon.
To do : 
Fix restitution being applied only during angled collisions ( resulting in rotational impulse ) 
Optimisations :
Partioning,
Add shapes and circles with their own functions, i.e. they don't use the current polygon-polygon checking which is cpu intensive
