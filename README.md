This is a custom 2D Rigid-body Physics Engine
---

Implements convex polygon collision detection via SAT, impulse-based resolution (including rotation and Coulomb friction), and a broadphase pipeline using AABBs + spatial partitioning for performance.

## Features
- [x] SAT convex polygon collision detection  
- [x] Impulse resolution with angular dynamics  
- [x] Coulomb friction (static/dynamic)  
- [x] Broadphase AABB culling  
- [x] Spatial partitioning
